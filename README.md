# Word-Guess-Game

The game will ask you a random question from the question pool.

The user has to try and solve the question by typing letters into the keyboard.

You are given a certian number of guess before you get the question wrong and lose. 

Correct guesses go into the word blank in the oder the come in the word.

Incorrect answers go into the incorrect guess pool. 

Once a word has been completed the game counts up on your score and moves to the next question.

This continues to stack as long as you keep completing the word correctly

If you run out of guesses before completing the word you lose your win streak and start back at 0
